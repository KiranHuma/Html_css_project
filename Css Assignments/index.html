            The <b>Cloud Native Computing program</b> prepares the students to program in open source
            technologies like,<b><i>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript,<br> Node.js, React and React Native</i></b> 
            while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development
            techniques on cloud <br>platforms like AWS.
          </p>
          <p class="Cloudnative" id="Cloudnative">Artificial Intelligence:</p>
          <p>
            The <b> artificial intelligence</b> program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI
            technology, via teaching programming in open source <br>languages like <b><i> Python, Numpy, Pandas,
                Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</i></b> and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and
            ending with real-life <br>examples of modern day AI in practice.
          </p>
          <p class="Cloudnative" id="Cloudnative">Blockchain:</p>
          <p>
            The main emphasis of <b> Blockchain:</b> program is to understand the blockchains like <b><i>Ethereum
                and Hyperledger (Fabric),</i> </b>and learn to program in languages such as <br>Solidity, JavaScript on
            frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps
            (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle <br>and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-aservice (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.
          </p>
          <p class="Cloudnative" id="Cloudnative">Internet of Things:</p>
          <p>
            The <b>Internet of things</b> program introduces the students to open source development
            technologies like Rust, Embedded <b><i>Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel,<br> Google Assistant,
                and Kubernetes</i></b> while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT
            Cloud, and voice computing for device control.
